      <h2><span class="first-letter">M</span>argin, border, and padding.</h2>

        <span class="a">Together, these three attributes make up the 'box model', which is a big part of how CSS determines the way DOM elements take up space in the browser window. <br>
      </span>

      <div class="box-wrapper">
      	<h6>the box model</h6>
      	<div class="box">
      		<p>Content</p>
      	</div>
      </div>

      <span class="q">What is the basic difference?</span>
      <span class="a">The border is the boundary between the element and it's surrounding DOM environment. In the diagram, the div with class "box" has a purple background and a white border. The white border seperates the purple background of the "box" div from the black background of the surrounding "box-container" div.<br>
      	Padding seperates the content (in this case, the word "content"), from the border. More padding, more space inside the div--in this case, more purple.<br>
      	Margin seperates the element from other elements in the containing div. In this case, that would be between the white boundary whatever else is floating around in the DOM with the 'box' div.<br>
      </span>

      <h2><span class="first-letter">C</span>lasses vs. Ids: best practices</h2>

      <span class="q">When should you use a class?</span>

      <span class="a">

        Classes can be applied many times, and a single DOM element can have many classes. This is powerful for giving structure to the visual appearance of page, and can allow you to quickly establish a coherent style website with lots of content and many pages. Partial overlap of the style classes between html elements  (i.e. some but not all classes shared), can be used to establish visual hierarchy and grouping.
        <br><br>
      </span>
      <span class="q">When should you use an ID?</span>

      <span class="a">

        One element may only have one ID, and an ID may only apply to a single element within an HTML documents. This limits their utility for styling; in general, classes give you more flexibility for the reasons above. However, IDs can be used to style elements that are unique within a page (but may appear on multiple pages within a site), such as a header, nav bar or footer.<br>
        IDs also allow you to anchor links within a page, and are very useful for that reason.

      <span class="q">What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</span>

      <span class="a">

        It actually sort of depends on which option you choose for the 'fractal shape' option. The default is a curly clockwise spiral which leads the eye around from branch to branch. This scales nicely as you zoom in on a very speciose taxon, but one problem I have with it is that it seems to visually imply an ordering among the taxa on a branch--which is arbitrary and not biologically real. One simple solution they could offer is a button to 'reshuffle' the ordering of the branches--to remind a relatively naive viewer that the ordering is in fact arbitrary. Even cooler would be you could click to drag branches and have them kind of spring back into some sort of shape, but to allow the user to rearrange the shape of the branches. This is why I like using <a href="http://michaeltrestman.github.io/D3treeExperiments/force.html"> force-diagrams</a>, although obviously my solution is still very primitive

      <span class="q">
      How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        <ul>
          <li>Dynamic (the whole point is that it's a zoomable, manipulable design solution)</li>
          <li>Elegant</li>
          <li>Clean</li>
          <li>Bright</li>
          <li>Simple</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
      </span>

      <span class="q">
      What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        The basic problem the site tries to solve is making datasets about phylogenetic relationships visually intuitive and explorable. They have pretty good datasets of tetrapods and green plants, although that's about it. This is actually a bit surprising. What is their data management solution like, that it isn't really easy to just add more archived data? A solution to this problem should be scalable. I wonder why they haven't expanded more.

      <span class="q">
      What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        <ul>
          <li>Educational (in a kind of minimal way that just presents the data in an explorable, self-explanatory way)</li>
          <li>Intuitive (as in, it is an attempt to use design to make something that is not intuitive--a phylogenetic dataset--visually comprehensible).</li>
          <li>limited--onezoom represents a one-off experiment in phylogenetic tree visualization, rather than an evolving, iterative approach to tackling this problem.</li>
          <li>Cutesy (this is not a good thing. I think the idea of a phylogenetic tree being depicted as literally like a plant has its limitations).</li>
          <li>Ummm, phylogenetic? I couldn't think of another adjective.</li>

      </span>
      <span class="a">
        Meh at best. Search functionality is not great, and even the search bar itself is hidden among a set of inscrutable buttons along a head-bar, that you have to hover over to see what they do.<br><br>
      </span>
      <span class="a">
      </span>
      <span class="q">How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        Fairly easy. Despite the fact that you have tens of thousands of taxa in their database, what onezoom does well is the dynamic zoom and pan, allowing you to quickly traverse this dataset using 2d graphic space as a proxy medium for phylogenetic relationships, a la <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=darwin+phylogenetic+tree&es_sm=91&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=zEWwU4mMCIOcyATpjIDQBA&ved=0CC4QsAQ&biw=1280&bih=679">the Darwinian conception</a>.

      <span class="q">How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)

      <span class="a">
        <ul>
          <li>Inspired--to improve on their attempt, </li>
          <li>frustrated--at the limitations of the site, </li>
          Really, I've never spent too much time browsing the site, compared to just cruising the phylogenetic data on even a visually static (and way crappier in a design senes) site like <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree/">tolweb.org</a>, because the latter has more actual info to explore (although tolweb kind of sucks because a lot of their tree data is super out of date--they must have implemented a really crappy database solution, if its so hard to update). Honestly, Wikipedia is still a better way to learn about phylogenetic relationships, because each taxonomic node has lots of extra information, so there's something to actually learn as you browse other than just a bunch of disembodies names arrayed in space--where most of the spatial organization is not actually informative.
        </ul>
        <br>
      
      <span class="q">Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        No I think it was paid for by a limited grant or something, which probably has a lot to do with why it hasn't been improved much beyond the original one-trick functionality.

      <a href="http://www.howlt.com/"><h2><span class="first-letter">h</span>owlt.com</h2></a>

      <span class="q">Why is this one of your favorite sites?</span>

      <span class="a">

          Well, I didn't know about this website until today, but the other sites I picked to blog about, I picked because of their content/function, without much regard for design aspects (except in a very functional sense). I discovered howlt.com via awwwards.com's list of best webistes. Really, this site breaks a lot of my general rules for what i consider good websites: I generally think bells and whistles should be kept to a minimum, and this website is basically just a collection of bells and whistles (it even starts playing music automatically on page-load, which seems like a terrible idea generally). However, it is a SUPER skillfully put together collection of bells and whistles, and it comes together for a really fun experience. navigating the website is like playing a game, and that is a really powerful thing to achieve. I also just think I can learn a lot of cool techniques by exploring the css and javascript for the site. 
        <br><br>
      </span>

      <span class="q">What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</span>

      <span class="a">

        The site is animated upon loading, with some weird blimp thing floating across the screen, and clouds, and weird little cartoony icons and things. it is somewhat visually confusing, but in an engaging, exploration-inviting way. As I noted already, this seems to me to totally break many of the rules of good web design, but in a deliberate and powerful way that can be very informative to study.

      <span class="q">
      What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        The website is basically just an artists playground. Its ostensive purpose is to display the artwork of the artist, Haruki Higashi, but the line between the artwork displayed and the website display as itself a work of art is totally permeable.

      </span>
      <span class="a">
        I think the list has to just be the same as the list above, since the design style of the website really just is its content/function; the two aren't really seperable.
      </span>

      <span class="q">How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        Not easy. You have to really explore with the mouse to even find what strange floating animated objects are nav links. Like I said, it's more like a game than a regular website.

      <span class="q">How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        Not easy, I really don't know how much of the content I've seen after playing with the website for a while. There is a top level nav bar, but there's nothing like a top level gallery of content to let you get your bearings. You just kind of wander around...<br><br>

      <span class="a">
             Amused and eager to learn some of the fancy CSS/JS techniques employed. <br>
      </span>
      <span class="q">Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        Ostensibly? There is an image that says "eshop coming soon"
