      <h2><span class="first-letter">W</span>ikipedia</h2>

      <span class="q">Why is this one of your favorite sites?</span>

      <span class="a">Wikipedia represents perhaps the largest project in knowledge agglomeration in human history. It is an encyplopedia of staggering scope, that would have awed intellectuals from throughout human history if they could have even conceived of its possibility. We are a priveleged few to live in a time that wikipedia exists. It is a anthropogenic miracle, one of the wonders of the world.<br><br>
      </span>

      <span class="q">What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</span>

      <span class="a">
      Wikipedia actually is sort of unusual in that most visitors don't see the root page. At least, that is my strong suspicion. I'd guess most visitors are directed to a content-page (i.e. an article) by a google search, or by following an internal link from another Wikipedia page. The 'Main Page', <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a> follows the format of other pages, highlighting the text content by keeping other things out of the way.
      </span><br><br>

      <span class="a">
      </span>

      <span class="q">
      How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        <ul>
          <li>Functional</li>
          <li>Minimal</li>
          <li>Simple</li>
          <li>Timeless</li>
          <li>Vast</li>
        </ul>
      </span>

      <span class="q">
      What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?
      </span>

      <span class="q">
      What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        <ul>
          <li>Informative (how could this not be on there?)</li>
          <li>Grand</li>
          <li>Ambitious</li>
          <li>Timeless</li>
          <li>Vast</li>
        </ul>
        Obviously the lists connected.<br><br>
      </span>

      <span class="q">How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        As noted above, a typical user doesn't navigate from the homepage. Wikipedia is pervasively integrated into the larger ecosystem of the web. Many wikipedia content pages are among the top few search hits from google and other engines, and most websites that aspire to be informative have links to Wikipedia.
      </span>
      <span class="a">
      </span>
      <span class="q">How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?
      </span>
      <span class="q">
        Even if Wikipedia stopped expanding its content now, it would take many lifetimes, but it is expanding all the time.
      </span>

      <span class="q">How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        <ul>
          <li>Satisfied, </li>
          <li>awed, </li>
          <li>bemused, </li>
          <li>amused, </li>
          <li>puzzled, </li>
          <li>stimulated, </li>
          <li>educated, </li>
          <li>empowered, </li>
          <li>powerful,</li>
          <li> most of all: informed.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      
      <span class="q">Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        Wikipedia is a nonprofit foundation run on donations, which is frigging awesome. I have donated, and plan to in the future.
